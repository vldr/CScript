The C compiler used in https://cpu.vldr.org/

## About
This C compiler is entirely made with Typescript.
It targets a custom processor named C15, which is a fictional CPU brought to life thanks to an FPGA.

The goal of this compiler is to be able to compile C code right from the browser 
and upload the compiled output directly to the CPU all in one place. 

## Try it out
You can now program the C15 CPU using the C language directly from your browser:
